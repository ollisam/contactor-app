# Contactor App

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), and [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev). This application was fully developed and tested on **iOS** using Expo.
Functionality and layout may vary on Android, as the app was not tested on that platform.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Keep in mind, as stated earlier, this app was only tested for and developed on iOS so it is recommended to select the **iOS simulator** in this case.
